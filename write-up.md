The data set has 113,937 loans along with 81 variables of each loan, including loan amount, interest rate ..etc. The story shed light on strong relationship that show correlation and point out the most important loan variables.

### Design


* **Map graph of USA cities that depicts the density of prosper loan by filtering the cities that have certain percentage of prosper loan.**
* **Dashboard to intensify the affect of income range in loans by showing the relationship between income and income verifiability and loan amount.**
* **Bar chart to show the relationship between occupation and the amount of loan.**
* **Bar short to depic loan status according to number of friends who invested in the loan.**

### Feedback
1. the first visual seems not to exist ? or there somethin wrong with my browser not sure
* **My changes: I added a caption by mistake and Tableau does not allow me to delete it >> My new story will have no redundant captions**
2. the second visual the map seems to be wrong
* **My changes: I changed the region/ cities filter to match USA cities**
3. the third visual/dashboard: on the right side the one to distinguish colors is confusing, should bee in order from highest to lowest or the opposite.
* **My changes: sort income range acsendingly**
4. the 4th visual, the pink bar chart for length of loan and status; i did not understand what is the purpose of it ?
* **My changes: it's supposed to show the number of pending/ completed status, I will add a more meaningful output by addign an attribute of number of investors; in order to see how number of investors affect loan status **
5. the fifth visual, the bar charts, i dont understand it, nor know what is the purpose of it
* **My changes:The bar sharts aim to show the number of loans taken over the years, I change the whole visual.**
6. the final visual seems interesting but needs more working; maybe can be split into different visuals by job and defaulting/unability of paying back the loan, and only show like top 10 or lowest 10
* **My changes: tweaked it as mentioned**
7. In first point, the points should be in USA not around the world 
* **My changes: Noted as it's I had this note earlier**
8. In the second part you mentioned in the graph that as income increases the loan amount increases but I see normal distribution in the graph 
* **My changes: it's negatively skewed or could say bimodal**
9. I couldn't see the message that you are trying to convie in this story. I think you should focus on a point or two
* **My changes: stated that in the first caption**
